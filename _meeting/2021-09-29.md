+ Multimodal Modeling of APC:
  + Predicting a future frame, or predicting a sequence of future frame
  + Candidates: clusters of possible phonemes, use GMM to model each
  + 2 models: $P(x_{t+k}|h_t), P(h_{t+k}|x_{1:t+k})$ cooperate each other
+ Todo:
  + Reproduce an APC baseline (can seek assistance from Gene to compare correctness)
  + Read papers about:
    + VQ
    + Co-train
  + Try transformers, NPC,...
+ Book/paper/mini-asr group:
  + Ask questions
+ Future plan/appliction
  + SoP: topic sentences
  + MS/PhD: talk with more people, keep thinking
