+ Multimodal Modeling of APC:
  + Predicting a future frame, or predicting a sequence of future frame([paper1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06659),[paper2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9040208/9052899/09053176.pdf
))
  + Candidates: clusters of possible phonemes, use GMM to model each
  + 2 models: $P(x_{t+k}\|h_t), P(h_{t+k}\|x_{1:t+k})$ cooperate each other, read this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07572
)
+ Todo:
  + Reproduce an APC baseline (can seek assistance from Gene to compare correctness)
  + Read papers about:
    + VQ
    + Co-train
  + Try transformers, NPC,...
  + Domain adaptation: [paper1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11825), [paper2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6287639/8600701/08883232.pdf)
+ Book/paper/mini-asr group:
  + Ask questions
+ Future plan/appliction
  + SoP: topic sentences
  + MS/PhD: talk with more people, keep thinking
