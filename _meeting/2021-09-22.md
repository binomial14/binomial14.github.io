+ Find courses of the School of Informatics: [https://course.inf.ed.ac.uk/](https://course.inf.ed.ac.uk/)
+ Some ideas for researching from Dr. Tang:
  + Multimodal modeling of APC. I should read this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03240).
  + Non-autoregressive approaches for ASR. I can read [the Chan et al. paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chan20b/chan20b.pdf) and look at [the non-autoregressive session in Interspeech 2021](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2021/index.html).
  + Analyzing end-to-end ASR trained on code-switched corpus. We can read [the book](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Cambridge_Handbook_of_Linguistic_Cod/CcV0pwAACAAJ?hl=en) together, and look at how end-to-end ASR systems deal with code switching. For example, why it is good, or how it can be better.
