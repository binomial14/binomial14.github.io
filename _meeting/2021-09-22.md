+ Find courses of the School of Informatics: [https://course.inf.ed.ac.uk/](https://course.inf.ed.ac.uk/)
+ Some ideas for researching from Dr. Tang:
  + Multimodal modeling of APC. This is what I talked about on the whiteboard. You can read the background knowledge in the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03240).
  + Non-autoregressive approaches for ASR. There are two places to look for ideas. One is to read [the Chan et al. paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chan20b/chan20b.pdf). The other is too look at [the non-autoregressive session in Interspeech 2021](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2021/index.html).
  + Analyzing end-to-end ASR trained on code-switched corpus. We might want to read [the following book](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Cambridge_Handbook_of_Linguistic_Cod/CcV0pwAACAAJ?hl=en) together, and look at how end-to-end ASR systems deal with code switching.
