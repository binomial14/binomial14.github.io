+ Domain Adaptation
  + Can follow the papers for the idea
  + [Unsupervised Domain Adaptation through Self-Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11825)
  + [Domain Adaptation in Distant Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04841)
+ SoP
  + [The Heilmeier Catechism](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism)
  + Reverse outlines
  + Develop high-level goals
  + It's more about the field, the school, not just you
  + [book1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Style-Lessons-Clarity-Joseph-Williams/dp/0134080416/), [book2](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Styling-Sentences-Longknife-Ph-D/dp/0764147838/), [book3](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary/dp/0060891548/)
  + Next:
    + Reorder: write new outlines first, and fill the paragraph afterward.
    + Think about the questions:
      + What is missing in the field? What is missing in myself? What can I gain in the school?
      + Why MS? Why Speech & Language Processing?
