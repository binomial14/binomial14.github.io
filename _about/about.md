My name is Liang-Yuan (Leo) Wu 吳兩原. I am now a research assistant working with Prof. [Dhruv "DJ" Jain](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~profdj/) and part of the [Soundability Lab](https://accessibility.eecs.umich.edu) at the AI Laboratory, University of Michigan CSE. I recently graduated with a Master's Degree in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Michigan.

My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), where I apply human-centered principles to enhance audio AI for diverse user needs, with a particular emphasis on accessibility for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals. Currently, I focus on two directions: (1) adapting large multimodal models to provide holistic and customizable audio scene understanding (2) improved speech recognition in healthcare.

I am now applying for a CS PhD starting in Fall 2025 and am excited to connect with and learn from professors and researchers who share similar interests!

<!-- Before that, I was a student majoring in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University from 2017 to 2021, and was a visiting student in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. I am interested in technology and believe that as an engineer, we have not only the ability to solve problems, but also have the ability to find problems out. I expect myself to be the one who can give efforts to make the world a little bit better!

My research interest is in Machine Learning and Speech & Language Processing. I also worked with Prof. [Emily Mower Provost](https://emp.engin.umich.edu) in the CHAI lab. Before that, I was working on self-supervised speech representation learning and advised by Dr. [Hao Tang](http://people.csail.mit.edu/haotang/) in [the Centre for Speech Technology Research](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. I was supervised by Prof. [Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and Prof. [Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/)  as a member of [NTU Speech Processing Lab](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/). I was an intern machine learning engineer in [Dragoncloud.ai](https://sites.google.com/view/abc123-ai/home), implemented ML systems for assisting English studying. After that, I joined [Ucarer](https://ucarer.tw) as an intern engineer, building an e-commerce platform and researching on customer relationship.

I visited [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) in Sep. 2021. I received [Y.L. Lin Scholarship]('https://scholarship.ylledu.org.tw/'), which is awarded to vision-driven and altruistic outgoing students. I was also awarded for [2021 National Taiwan University Outgoing Exchange Student Scholarship](https://oia.ntu.edu.tw/en/page/index/menu_sn/2561).

Besides, I am a maker and have implemented some special projects, including the Automatic Forehead Thermometer and the NTUEE Light Dance. I have also held one of the largest maker events in Taiwan: [MakeNTU](https://make.ntuee.org/). -->
