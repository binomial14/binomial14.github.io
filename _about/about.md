My name is Liang-Yuan "Leo" Wu 吳兩原. I am now working with Prof. [Dhruv "DJ" Jain](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~profdj/) and the [Soundability Lab](https://accessibility.eecs.umich.edu) at the AI Laboratory, University of Michigan CSE. I recently graduated with a Master's Degree in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Michigan.

I’m a researcher and engineer working at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a focus on building human-centered technologies that make sound and speech more accessible. My work often involves close collaboration with the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community to explore how people perceive, trust, and engage with audio AI.

My recent work includes, (1) using large multimodal models to interpret auditory scenes and generate personalized sound descriptions, (2) improving captioning quality with large language models (LLMs), and (3) exploring captioning usage in constrained environments such as clinical communication.

I have hands-on experience in software development, with a background in deep learning, audio and language processing, and full-stack development. I also bring experience in UX research, including mixed-methods evaluation with users. **Currently, I'm exploring research and industry opportunities in audio AI and human-centered machine learning.** I’m always excited about new collaborations and conversations, please feel free to reach out!

<!-- Before that, I was a student majoring in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University from 2017 to 2021, and was a visiting student in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. I am interested in technology and believe that as an engineer, we have not only the ability to solve problems, but also have the ability to find problems out. I expect myself to be the one who can give efforts to make the world a little bit better!

My research interest is in Machine Learning and Speech & Language Processing. I also worked with Prof. [Emily Mower Provost](https://emp.engin.umich.edu) in the CHAI lab. Before that, I was working on self-supervised speech representation learning and advised by Dr. [Hao Tang](http://people.csail.mit.edu/haotang/) in [the Centre for Speech Technology Research](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. I was supervised by Prof. [Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and Prof. [Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/)  as a member of [NTU Speech Processing Lab](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/). I was an intern machine learning engineer in [Dragoncloud.ai](https://sites.google.com/view/abc123-ai/home), implemented ML systems for assisting English studying. After that, I joined [Ucarer](https://ucarer.tw) as an intern engineer, building an e-commerce platform and researching on customer relationship.

I visited [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) in Sep. 2021. I received [Y.L. Lin Scholarship]('https://scholarship.ylledu.org.tw/'), which is awarded to vision-driven and altruistic outgoing students. I was also awarded for [2021 National Taiwan University Outgoing Exchange Student Scholarship](https://oia.ntu.edu.tw/en/page/index/menu_sn/2561).

Besides, I am a maker and have implemented some special projects, including the Automatic Forehead Thermometer and the NTUEE Light Dance. I have also held one of the largest maker events in Taiwan: [MakeNTU](https://make.ntuee.org/). -->
