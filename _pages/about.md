My name is Liang-Yuan Wu. I am now a visiting student in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. I was a student majoring in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University from 2017 to 2021. I am interested in techniques and believe that as an engineer, we have not only the ability to solve problems, but also have the ability to find problems out. I expect myself to be the one who can give efforts to make the world a little bit better!

My research interest is in Machine Learning and Speech & Language Processing. I currently focus on auto-grgressive predictive coding and advised by Dr. [Hao Tang](http://people.csail.mit.edu/haotang/) in [the Centre for Speech Technology Research](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh. I was supervised by Prof. [Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and Prof. [Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/)  as a member of [NTU Speech Processing Lab](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/). I was an intern machine learning engineer in [Dragoncloud.ai](https://sites.google.com/view/abc123-ai/home), implemented ML systems for assisting English studying. After that, I joined [Ucarer](https://ucarer.tw) as an intern engineer, building an e-commerce platform and researching on customer relationship.

I visited [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) in Sep. 2021. I received [Y.L. Lin Scholarship]('https://scholarship.ylledu.org.tw/'), which is awarded to vision-driven and altruistic outgoing students. I was also awarded for [2021 National Taiwan University Outgoing Exchange Student Scholarship](https://oia.ntu.edu.tw/en/page/index/menu_sn/2561).

Besides, I am a maker and have implemented some special projects, including the Automatic Forehead Thermometer and the NTUEE Light Dance. I have also held one of the largest maker events in Taiwan: [MakeNTU](https://make.ntuee.org/).

## Special Experiences

### Automatic Forehead Thermometer

Due to the threat of Covid-19, we built an automatic forehead thermometer that can help with access control. Our product was deployed in every buildings in NTU and some other facilities. We were given a special award from NTU, Social Devotion Special Award.

The news report of our work can be found [here](https://flipedu.parenting.com.tw/article/6004)

I was the general cooperator of NTUEE Light Dance. We built a system of programable dance clothes that can sync with music. The highlight of our dance show was the light effect on our clothes. You'll definitely amazed by our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTdngU70CHo)!

I was the general cooperator of 2020 MakeNTU Makeathon, leading a team over 80 members to hold 2 day makeathon about IOT for all undergraduates over Taiwan. There were over 150 competitors with diverse backgrounds such as EE, CS, ME, Dentistry and so on. This competition was collaborated with [Ministry of Education](https://english.moe.gov.tw/mp-1.html), and more than 10 international companies including [GOOGLE](https://about.google), [ARROW](https://www.arrow.com), [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com) and so on.
