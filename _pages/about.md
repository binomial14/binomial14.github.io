Hi! My name is Liang-Yuan Wu, and you can call me Leo. I am a senior student majoring in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. I am interested in techniques and believe that as an engineer, we have not only the ability to solve problems, but also have the ability to find problems out. I expect myself to be the one who can give efforts to make the world a little bit better!

I'm skilled at processing data in machine learning approach and web service building. Currently, I am supervised by Prof. [Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and Prof. [Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/)  as a member of [NTU Speech Processing Lab](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/). My research interest is in machine learning and natural language processing. I currently focus on word embeddings in multilingual models, and code-switching sentence generation. I am currently also an intern machine learning engineer in [Dragoncloud.ai](http://www.abc123.ai) since May, 2020, and an AI platform intern in [Ucarer Inc.](https://ucarer.tw) since March, 2021.

I am going to be an exchange student in [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) in Sep. 2021. I have been awarded for [2021 National Taiwan University Outgoing Exchange Student Scholarshiip](https://oia.ntu.edu.tw/en/page/index/menu_sn/2561), which is given to the exchange students with excellent internal screening score.

In leisure time, I am a maker and love hand-made stuffs. I was just awarded the conference award: Best Solver in 2021 MakeNTU. I also like basketball very much, and I was the starting shooting guard in NTUEE basketball team.
