+ Domain Adaptation
  + Fix the classifier, modify the pre-trained model
  + Use corrputed WSJ as test dataset(target domain)
  + Can try corrputed LibriSpeech in Pretraining, different noise as different domain
  + How to corrupt dataset
    + Use librosa (or [speechbrain](https://speechbrain.github.io) or [lhotse](https://github.com/lhotse-speech/lhotse))  to modify the waveform
    + Noise: [MUSAN](https://openslr.org/17/)
+ Application
  + SoP
    + Motivation: ex: interest of language, speech technology development, model understand/not understand, human well-being(trust, privacy)
    + I would try to work on the interest of language and the connection between language and technology
