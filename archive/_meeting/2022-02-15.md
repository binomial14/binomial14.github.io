+ Progress
  + APC model: check the training curve (phoneme classification should have 0.25 PER)
  + Baseline: 3 layer LSTM (same structure with the APC, but randomly initiallized)
  + APC on corrupted dataset: add noise on-the-fly, jointly on noise corrupted and not corrupted
  + APC on LS+WSJ: the two datasets should be shuffled
  + APC on clean dataset and noise
+ Hypotheses
  + The APC model has the ability to transfer the information of noise
  + The domain shift in APC is smaller than the classifier (more robust)
+ Next time
  + Modify the pipeline, get new numbers
  + Write the template, topic sentences
