I assisted NTUEE freshman students to build a path following automatic robot based on Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

I have written an article to introduce this course, you can find it [here](https://alumni.ee.ntu.edu.tw/?p=4597).

I am also the general editor of the [Maker Manual](https://ntuee-makerspace.gitbook.io/makermanual/), which collects many maker skills. This manual is now managed by NTUEE Student Association Academic Department.
