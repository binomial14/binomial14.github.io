This course is designed for all NTU students to gain basic knowledge of machine learning, and it is lectured in both Mandarin and English. In 2021 spring, there were 1379 students enrolling the class. 

I was in charge of the design and grading of the project, [Explainable AI](https://github.com/ga642381/ML2021-Spring/tree/main/HW09). This project provides 2 main topics of model explanation, CNN and BERT. The students need to understand the idea of different method, read and modify the sample code, and answer some questions based on their observation.  I also assisted [Prof. Hung-Yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.html) for answering students' questions about the course.
