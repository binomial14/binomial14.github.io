I was the general cooperator of 2020 MakeNTU Makeathon, leading a team over 80 members to hold 2 day makeathon about IOT for all undergraduates over Taiwan. There were over 150 competitors with diverse backgrounds such as EE, CS, ME, Dentistry and so on. This competition was collaborated with [Ministry of Education](https://english.moe.gov.tw/mp-1.html), and more than 10 international companies including [GOOGLE](https://about.google), [ARROW](https://www.arrow.com), [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com) and so on.
