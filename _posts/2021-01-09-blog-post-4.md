## Introduction

### Operating System goals/definitions

+ A software that manages computer hardware
+ An interface for users to communicate with hardware
+ A platform for programs to run

1. Resourse Allocator
2. Control Program

### Couputer System Structure

+ Hardware
+ Operating System
+ Application Programs

### Definitions

+ kernel: the on program running at all times
+ bootstrap program: loaded at power-up or reboot
+ interrupt: devices inform CPU that it has finished its operation
+ trap/exception: a software-generated interrupt caused by an error or a user request

### I/O Structure

+ Synchronous: control returns to user program only upon I/O completion
+ Asynchronous: control returns to user program without waiting for I/O completion
  + System call: request to the OS to allow user to wait
  + Device-status table: contains entry for each I/O device

### Storage Definition

+ The basic unit is the **bit**
+ 8 bits is a **byte**
+ The native unit of data: **word**(8 bytes)
+ caching: copying information into faster storage system(main memory as a chche for secondary storage)
+ device driver: interface between controller and kernel

#### Storage-Device Hieracrchy

+ register
+ cache
+ main memory
+ solid-state disk
+ magnetic disk
+ optical disk
+ magnetic tapes

#### Strorage Structure

+ Main Memory: CPU can access directly
  + Random access
  + Volatile
+ Secondary Storage: provide nonvolatile storage capacity
+ Magnetic Disks:
  + Tracks, and sectors
  + Disk controller, determine the logical interaction between the device and the computer
+ Solid-state Disks: faster than magnetic disks, nonvolatile

### Multiprocessor

+ Also known as parallel systems, tightly-coupled systems
+ Advantages:
  + Increased Throughput
  + Economy of scale
  + Increased reliability
+ Two types:
  + Asymmetric Multiprocessing
  + Symmetric Multiprocessing

### Clustered Systems

+ Storage-area netword(SAN): share strorage
+ Asymmetric clustering: one machine in hot-standby mode
+ Symmetric clustering: multiple nudes running, monitoring each other

### Multiprogramming

+ organize jobs so CPU always has one to execute
+ Timesharing(multimasking): CPU swiches jobs so frequently that user can interact with each job

### Dual-mode

+ User mode and kernel mode
+ Allow OS to protect iteself and other system components
+ multimode, ex: virtual machine manager mode

### Timer

+ Set interrupt after specific period
+ Set up before scheduling process to regain control or terminate program that exceeds allotted time

### Process Management

+ program counter: specify the location of next instructionto execute
+ activities:
  + create/delete user/system processes
  + suspend/resume processes
  + provide mechanisms for process synchronization
  + provide mechanisms for process communication
  + provide mechanisms for deadlock handling

### Memory managment

+ keep track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom
+ decide which processes and data to move into and out of memory
+ allocate/deallocate memory space

### Storage management

+ create/delete files and directories
+ primitive to manipulate files and directories
+ mapping files onto secondary storage
+ backup files onto stable storage media

### Mass-storage management

+ free-space management
+ storage allocation
+ disk scheduling

### protection & security

+ protection: any mechanism for controlling access of processes or users to resources
+ security: defense of the system against external attacks

## System Structures

### OS services

+ User interface
+ Program execution
+ I/O operations
+ File-system manipulation
+ Communications
+ Error detection
+ Memory management
  + Resouce allocation
  + Accounting: keep track of which users use how much and what kind of resources
  + Protection and Security

### System calls

+ programming interface to the services provided by the OS
+ mostly via API
+ system call interface: a table indexed according to the numbers associated with each system call
+ pass parameters to the OS
  + simplest: pass in registers
  + block: parameters stored in a block, and address of block passed in a register
  + stack: parameters pushed onto the stack and popped off

### Design and implement

+ policy: what will be done
+ mechanism: how to do it
+ allow flexibility if policy decisions are to be changed later

### Microkernel System Structure

+ easier to extend
+ easier to port the OS to new architectures
+ more reliable
+ more secure
+ but performance overhead

### Virtual Machines

+ the OS host creates the illusion that a process has its own processor and virtual memory

### System Boot

+ when power initialized on system, execution starts at a fixed memory location
+ bootstrap loader loads into memory and start it
+ kernel loads then system is running

## Process Concepts

+ process: a program in execution
+ parts
  + text section
  + program counter
  + stack: data
  + data section: global variables
  + heap: memory dynamically allocated
+ types:
  + I/O-bound process
  + CPU-bound process

### process state

+ new
+ running
+ waiting
+ ready
+ terminated

### process control block(PCB)

+ process state
+ preogram counter: location of instruction to next execute
+ CPI registers
+ CPU scheduling information
+ memory management information
+ accounting information
+ I/O status information

### process scheduling

+ job queue
+ ready queue
+ device queues

### schedulers

+ long-term scheduler(job scheduler): which process should be brought to the ready queue
+ short-term scheduler(CPU scheduler): which process should be executed next and allocates CPU

### context switch

+ CPU switch to another process, the system must save the state and load the saved state
+ context of a process represented in the PCB

### process operations

+ creation
  + parent create children
  + identified via a process identifier(pid)
  + fork(): system call creates new process
  + exec(): system call to replace the process memory space with a new program
+ termination

#### chrome browser

+ multiprocess
  + browser
  + renderer
  + plug-in

### interprocess communication(IPC)

+ shared memory
+ message passing
  + send()
  + reveive()
  + establish a communication link
+ Synchronization
  + Blocking(synchronous)
    + blocking send
    + blocking receive
  + Non-blocking(asynchronous)
    + non-blocking send
    + non-blocking receive

### communication in client-server

+ socket: endpoint for communication
  + TCP: connection-oriented
  + UDP: connectionless
  + MulticastSocket
+ remote procedure calls(RPC)
  + stub: client side proxy
+ remote method invocation(RMI)
+ pipes
  + write-end
  + read-end

## Multithreaded Programming

### Multithreaded Server Architecture

Client **request** server, server **create** new thread to service the request, the server resume listening

### Benefits

+ Responsiveness
+ Resource sharing
+ Economy: light weight process(LWP)
+ Scalability

### Multicore Programming

+ parallelism: a system can perform more than one task simultaneously
  + data parallelism
  + task parallelism
+ concurrency: support more than one task making progress

### multithreading models

+ Many-to-one
  + many user threads mapped to single kernel thread
+ One-to-one
  + each user thread mapped to kernel thread
+ Many-to-many
  + many user threads mapped to many kernel threads

### thread library

provides programmer with API for creating and managing threads

+ Pthreads: may be provided as user-level or kernel-level
+ Java Threads: managed by JVM

### Implicit threading

creation and mangagement of threads done by compilers and run-time libraries rather than programmers

+ Thread pools: create a number of threads in a pool where they await work
+ OpenMP: provide support for parallel programming in shared-memory environments
+ Grand Central Dispatch: allow identification of parallel sections
  + serial
  + concurrent

### Threading Issues

+ sementics of fork() and exec()
+ signal handling
  + default handler
  + user-defined handler
+ thread cancellation
  + Asynchronous cancellation
  + Deferred cancellation: allow the target thread to periodically check if it should be cancelled
+ thread local storage(TLS): allow each thread to have its own copy of data
+ scheduler activations: LWP between user and kernel threads

## Process Scheduling

+ CPU burst
+ I/O burst

### CPU scheduler

+ short-term scheduler: select from the processes in ready queue, and allocate the CPU to one of them
  + nonpreemptive:
    + switch from running to waiting
    + switch from running to ready
    + switch from waiting to ready
    + terminate
  + preemptive
  + **dispatcher**: give control of the CPU to the process selected

### scheduling criteria

+ CPU utilization
+ Throughput: # of processes
+ Turnaround time: amount of time to execute the process
+ Waiting time: amount of time to wait in the ready queue
+ Response time: amount of time from a request submitted until the first response

### Scheduling Methods

#### First come, First-service(FCFS)

+ convoy effect: short process behind long process

#### Shortest Job First(SJF)

It is optimal, the difficulty is knowing the length of the next CPU

#### Priority scheduling

+ Starvation: low priority processes may never execute
+ Aging: as time progress increase the priority

#### Round Robin(RR)

+ time quantum: after this time, the process is preempted

### Multilevel Queue

+ foreground(interactive): RR
+ background(batch): FCFS

### Thread scheduling

+ process contention scope(PCS): competition within the process
+ system contention scope(SCS): competition among all processes

### Multiple-processor scheduling

+ Homogeneous processor within a multiprocessor
+ Asymmetric multiprocessing: only one processor access the system data
+ Symmetric multiprocesssing: each processor is self-scheduling
+ processor affinity

### Real-time CPU scheduling

+ soft real-time system
+ hard real-time system
+ latencies:
  + interrupt latency
  + dispatch latency

### priority-based scheduling

#### rate montonic scheduling

+ a priority is affigned based on the inverse of its period

#### earliest deadline first scheduling(EDF)

+ priority is assigned according to deadline

#### proportional share scheduling

+ each application receives N/T

### Little's Formula

+ n: average queue length
+ W: average waiting time in queue
+ $\lambda$ : average arrival rate into queue

$$n = \lambda * W$$

## Synchronization

### background

Processes can be execute concurrently, and might lead to data inconsistency.

+ race condition: the problem of synchronization
+ critical section problem: process may be changing common variables

### Solutions

#### Requirements

+ Mutual Exclusion(MUTEX): If a process is executing in its cirtical section, then no other processes can be executing in its critical section
+ Progress: No process in critial section and there are some wish to enter, the selection of the processess can't be postponed indefinitely
+ Bound Waiting: A bound for the number of times the other processes enter the critical section.

### Peterson's Solution

+ atomic: can't be interrupted
+ 2 processes share:
  + turn: whose turn to enter the critical section
  + flag[2]: indicate if the process is ready

### Bakery Algorithm

+ Originally designed for distributed systems
+ 2 arrays
  + number[i]: Pi's token number
  + choosing[i]: Pi is taking a number

### Synchronization Hardware

+ protecting critical sections via locks
+ use 2 methods to set lock:
  + test_and_set()
  + compare_and_swap()

### Mutex Locks

+ also called "spinlock"
+ busy waiting
+ acquire(): get the lock
+ release(): release the lock

### Semaphore

+ no need of busy waiting
+ 2 operations
  + wait()
  + signal()

### problems

#### deadlock

2 or more processes are waiting indefinitely for an event that can be caused by only one of the waiting processes

#### starvation

A process may never be removed from the semaphore queue

### Monitors

+ signal and wait
+ signal and continue

## Deadlocks

### Definition

A set of blocked processes each holding a resource and waiting to acquire resource held by another process.

#### Charaterization

+ Mutual exclusion
+ Hold and wait
+ No preemption
+ Circular wait

### System Model

+ Each process utilizes a resource:
  + request
  + use
  + release

### Avoidance

+ Each process declare the maximum number
+ safe state
  + if pi resource needs aren't available, it can wait until all pj finished
  + when pj is finished, pi can obtain needed resources
  + when pi terminates pi+1 can obtain its needed resources

### Resource-allocation Graph

The request can be granted only if converting the request edge to an assignment edge doesn't result in the formation of a cycle.

### Banker's Algorithm

+ multiple instances
+ data structure:
  + Available
  + Max
  + Allocation
  + Need: Max-Allocation
+ safety algorithm
  1. Initialize
     + Work = Available
     + Finish[i] = false
  2. find an i that:
     + Finish[i] = false
     + Needi <= Work
     + if no, go to 4
  3. After these, go back to 2
      + Work += Allocation
      + Finish[i] = true
  4. If Finish[i] == true for all i, it's safe
+ algorithm
  + Available -= Request
  + Allocation += Request
  + Need -= Request
  + If safe, do allocation; if unsage, wait.

### Detection Algorithm

It's O(mn^2)

1. Work: m, Finish: n
    + Work = Available
    + Finish[i] = false if Allocation[i] != 0, else, true
2. Find an i that:
    + Finish[i] = false
    + Request[i] < Work
    + if no, go to 4
3. After these, go back to 2
     + Work += Allocation
     + Finish[i] = true
4. If Finish[i] == false for some i, it's in deadlock

### Recovery

#### Process Termination

+ abort all deadlocked processes
+ abort one by one untile the cycle is eliminated

#### Resource Preemption

+ Select a victim
+ Rollback
+ Starvation

## Memory-management Strategies

### Background

+ Main memory can take many cycles, causing a **stall**(too slow to access memory)

### Base and Limit registers

+ a pair of base and limit define the logical address space

### Binding

+ compile time
+ load time
+ execution time

### address space

+ logical: generated by CPU, virtual address
+ physical: address seen by the memory unit

### Memory Management Unit(MMU)

+ map virtual to physical address

### Swapping

+ a process can be swqpped temporarily out of memory to a backing store, and then brought back
  + backing store: fast disk to accomodate copies
  + roll out, roll in: lower priority out, higher priority be loaded

### Contiguous Allocation

+ fixed partitions
+ pros:
  + bound registers
  + each partition may have a protection key
+ cons:
  + fragmentation gives poor memory utilization

### Dynamic Storage-Allocation Problem

+ First-fit: allocate the first hole
+ Best-fit: allocate the smallest hole
+ Worst-fit: allocate the largest hole

### Fragmentation

+ External Fragmentation: total memory space exists, but not contiguous
+ Internal Fragmentation: allocated memory space be larger than requested memory
+ Reduce External Fragmentation
  + compaction: put free spce together
+ Dynamic Partition
  + pros:
    + eliminate fragmentation to some degree
    + have more partitions and a higher degree of multiprogramming
  + cons:
    + relocation cost

### Segmentation

+ Memory-management scheme that supports user view of memory
+ Segment table
  + base: contains the physical address (segment-table base register)
  + limit: specify the length of the segment (segment-table length register)

### paging

+ frames: divide physical memory into fixed-sized blocks
+ pages: divide logical memory into blocks of same size
+ page number: in a page table which contains base address of each page
+ page offset: base address
+ Increase context-switch time

#### Associative memory/Translation look-aside buffers(TLBs)

+ Fast-lookup hardware cache.
+ Store address-space identtifiers

#### Memory protection

+ valid-incalid bit
+ Page Table Length Register

### Shared Pages

+ shared code: one copy of read-only code shared among processes
+ private code and data: each process keeps a separate copy

### Multilevel paging

+ The logical address space of a process is very large
+ Hierarchical Page table: break up intot multiple page tables

### Hashed page tables

### Inverted page table

+ pros:
  + decrease the amount of memory needed to store each page table
+ cons:
  + sorted by virtual address
  + difficult to implement with shared memory

## Virtual-memory Management

### Virtual memory

+ Entire program code not needed at the same time, the ability to execute partially-loaded program
+ virtual memory: separation of user logical memory from physical memory
+ can be implemented:
  + Demand paging
  + Demand segmentation

### Demand Paging

+ could bring entire process into memory
+ lazy swapper: never swaps a page into memory unless page will be needed
+ valid-invalid bit:
  + v: in memory
  + i: not in memory (page fault)

#### page fault

1. OS look at another table
2. Get empty frame
3. Seap page into frame
4. Reset table
5. Set validation bit v
6. Restart the instruction

### Process Creation

#### copy-on-write

+ allow both parent and child processes to initially share the same pages in memory

### page replacement

+ prevent over-allocation of memory
+ use modify bit to reduce overhead of page transfers

1. Find the location of the desired page
2. Find a free frame
   1. If no free frame, select a victim frame
3. Bring the page into the free frame, update
4. Continue the process

#### comparison

+ frame-allocation algorithm
  + how many frames to give each process
  + which frame to replace
+ page-replacement algorithm
  + lowest page-fault rate

### algorithms

+ FIFO
+ Optimal algorithm
  + replace page that will not be used for longest period of time
+ Least recently used(LRU)
+ Most frequently used(MFU)

### global vs local

+ global replacement: process selects a replacement frame from all frames
+ local replacement: process selects from its own set of allocated frames

### Thrashing

+ high page-fault rate
+ a process is busy swapping
+ low CPU utilization

### Memory-mapped files

+ mapping a disk block to a page in memory

### Buddy System

+ allocate memory from fixed-size segment consisting of physically-contiguous pages
+ using power of 2 allocator
+ pros: quickly coalesce unused chunks into larger chunk
+ cons: fragmentation

### Slab allocator

+ slab: one or more physically contiguous pages
+ cache: consist of one or more slab
