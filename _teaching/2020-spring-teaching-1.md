This course is for all NTU students to gain basic knowledge of machine learning. In 2021 spring, there are 1465 students enrolled the class.

I was in charge of the design and grading of the project, Explainable AI. I also assisted Prof. Hung-Yi Lee for answering students' questions about the course.
