This course is designed for all NTU students to gain basic knowledge of machine learning, and it is lectured in both Mandarin and English. In 2021 spring, there are 1379 students enrolled the class. 

I was in charge of the design and grading of the project, Explainable AI. I also assisted Prof. Hung-Yi Lee for answering students' questions about the course.
